# Controlling running sounds in Sonic-Pi

## Controlling running synths - can pass any of the standard opts to control as well, like amp:, cutoff:, and pan:
#s = play 60, release: 5 # run-local variable, meaning it can only be accessed in this run/buffer
# (unlike functions, which can be accessed in other ones)
#sleep 0.5
#control s, note: 65
#sleep 0.5
#control s, note: 67
#sleep 3
#control s, note: 72
# However, there are opts that can't be controlled once the synth has started (like all the ADSR - attack, decay, sustain, release -
# envelope parameters & any opts that say "can't be changed once set" in the documentation)

## Controlling FX
#with_fx :reverb do |r|
#  play 50
#  sleep 0.5
#  control r, mix: 0.7
#  play 55
#  sleep 1
#  control r, mix: 0.9
#  sleep 1
#  play 62
#end

## Sliding Options
#s = play 60, release: 5, note_slide: 0.2 # note_slide makes the pitch slide between note changes & the number dictates the slide time
# (but only when using control, and other controllable parameters also have a _slide parameter)
#sleep 0.5
#control s, note: 65
#sleep 0.5
#control s, note: 67
#sleep 3
#control s, note: 72
### once a _slide parameter's set on a running synth, it'll be used every time that corresponding parameter slides, so
### stopping the slide requires setting the _slide to 0 before the next control is called

### Using _slide with FX options
#with_fx :wobble, phase: 1, phase_slide: 5 do |e|
#  use_synth :dsaw
#  play 50, release: 5
#  control e, phase: 0.025
#end
