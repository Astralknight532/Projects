# Overview of Sonic Pi's ADSR envelopes
# attack - amount of time to go from 0 amplitude to the value of attack_level
# decay - amount of time to move the amplitude from the value of attack_level to the value of decay_level
# sustain - amount of time to move the amplitude from the value of decay_level to the value of sustain_level
# release - amount of time to move the amplitude from the value of sustain_level to 0

# the duration of a sound is the sum of these 4 phases' times
play 60, attack: 0.5, attack_level: 1, decay: 1, sustain_level: 0.4, sustain: 2, release: 0.5 # this sound will have a duration of 4 beats
# attack + decay + sustain + release -> 0.5 + 1 + 2 + 0.5 = 4
