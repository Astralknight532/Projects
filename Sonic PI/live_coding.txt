# Live Coding in Sonic-Pi

## Fundamentals
#define :my_sound do
#  use_synth :tb303
#  sample :drum_bass_hard, rate: rrand(0.5, 2)
#  play choose(chord(:e3, :minor)), release: 0.2, cutoff: rrand(60, 130)
#  sleep 0.25
#end

#in_thread(name: :looper) do
#  loop do
#    my_sound
#  end
#end

## Live Loops
#live_loop :foo do
#  sample :loop_garzul
#  use_synth :prophet
#  play :c1, release: 8, cutoff: rrand(70, 130)
#  sleep 8
#end

## Multiple Live Loops
#live_loop :foo do
#  use_synth :prophet
#  play :e1, release: 8, cutoff: rrand(70, 130)
#  sleep 8
#end

#live_loop :bar do
#  sample :bd_haus
#  sleep 0.5
#end

#live_loop :foo do
#  play :e4, release: 0.5
#  sleep 0.5
#end

#live_loop :bar do
#  sync :foo
#  sample :bd_haus
#  sleep 1
#end

## Ticking
#counter = 0
#live_loop :arp do
#  play (scale :e3, :minor_pentatonic)[counter], release: 0.1
#  counter += 1
#  sleep 0.125
#end

### the above is similar to the below: get the E3 minor pentatonic scale & ticking through each element (this .tick is local to the live loop, so loop can have its own tick)
#live_loop :arp do
#  play (scale :e3, :minor_pentatonic).tick, release: 0.1
#  sleep 0.125
#end

#live_loop :arp2 do
#  use_synth :dsaw
#  play (scale :e2, :minor_pentatonic).tick, release: 0.25
#  sleep 0.25
#end

### Can also call tick as a function and use the value as an index, but it's nicer to call .tick at the end
### Calling tick as a function is useful for fancy actions using the tick value or for other things besides indexing rings
#live_loop :arp do
#  idx = tick
#  play (scale :e3, :minor_pentatonic)[idx], release: 0.1
#  sleep 0.125
#end

### tick doesn't just return a new index (or a ring's value at a given index), it also ensures that the next value is supplied
### the next time tick is called
### If you just want to access the current tick value but not increase it, use the look function (either as a standard function
### or by adding .look to the end of a ring)

### Naming ticks - for when you need multiple ticks in a live_loop
live_loop :arp do
  play (scale :e3, :minor_pentatonic).tick(:foo), release: 0.1
  sleep (ring 0.125, 0.25).tick(:bar)
end
