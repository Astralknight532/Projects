# Using external samples:
# sample "full file path" (parameters)
# example:
# sample "C:/Users/test/Desktop/test_sound.wav", rate: 0.5, amp: 0.3

# Using external sample packs:
# can index the samples inside the packs
# sample "full file path to sample folder (instead of individual samples)", 0 #sets the 1st sample as index 0

# Can also use a variable to make a shortcut to the folder with the samples
# samps = "full file path to folder"
# sample samps, 0 # sets 1st sample in the folder as index 0

# Set 2nd sample in the folder
